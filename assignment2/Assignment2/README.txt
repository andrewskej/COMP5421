(f) this project was originally created in MacOS environment (via XCode), but final prepped(Readme, zip..) in Windows. 
therefore, the output_file_A2.txt contains the results from Mac OS.
It was tested in both environment and should work in both without any problem, but please let me know if not.



[Possible issue - troubleshooting]:
the source file, "Seuss", sometimes changes ' <- this upperstrophe to â€™ <- unreadable upperstrophe, 
when the text file was moved between mac and windows environment. 
If menu number 1 creates an error on windows environment due to this error, please kindly replace the Seuss.txt file.
